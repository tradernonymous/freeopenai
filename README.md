      <h3>💬 Chat</h3>
      Ask anything and get a streamed, markdown-rendered reply in a centered 768px column at compact density. Web research rides every turn — the model searches (DuckDuckGo + Wikipedia) and reads pages itself, citing sources, instead of guessing or sticking to your repos. Starts on a prompt hero with suggestion cards, copy or retry any response, Ctrl+P palette for models and actions, turn stats (model · seconds · chars) in the status bar, and dark/light plus tokyonight/gruvbox/auto themes in the header.

      Toggle the image icon next to the input to generate a picture instead of chatting. A labelled shimmer placeholder holds the spot while it renders (instant failures say so instead of flashing past).

      <h3>🔌 Six providers</h3>
      Puter needs no key at all. Add a key for Nara, OpenRouter, NVIDIA, Mistral or AI Gateway and they appear in a picker — so one running dry never stops the work. A local Ollama joins with just a base URL and needs no key. Keys stay on the server.

      <h3>📱 Built for a phone</h3>
      A slide-out drawer, safe-area insets, 16px inputs so iOS doesn't zoom, a Send key on soft keyboards, no double-tap delay, a layout that resizes with the keyboard instead of hiding behind it, wrapped links, capped image heights, and controls that shrink rather than shove each other off a 375px screen.

      <h3>⚡ SSE streaming</h3>
      Direct-provider replies arrive token-by-token via Server-Sent Events — no waiting for the full answer before text appears.

<br>

This is the curated Puter.js list — no OpenAI account or key required on your end. Add a provider key and its own catalogue is fetched live instead, ranked free-first.

| Model | Description | Id |
| --- | --- | :---: |
| **GPT-6 Astra** | Newest, most capable — complex reasoning, coding, computer use | `gpt-6-astra` |
| **GPT-5.6 Sol** | Flagship of the 5.6 family | `gpt-5.6-sol` |
| **GPT-5.6 Terra** | Mid-tier | `gpt-5.6-terra` |
| **GPT-5.6 Luna** | Smallest, cheapest of the 5.6 family | `gpt-5.6-luna` |
| **GPT-5.4 Nano** | Fast, cheap — the default | `gpt-5.4-nano` |
| **GPT-4o** | Balanced, general-purpose | `gpt-4o` |
| **GPT-4o Mini** | Fast and cheap | `gpt-4o-mini` |
| **GPT-5.3 / 5.2 Codex** | Coding-tuned | `openai/gpt-5.3-codex`, `openai/gpt-5.2-codex` |
| **GPT-5.1 Codex Max** | Coding, max context | `openai/gpt-5.1-codex-max` |
| **Claude Opus 5** | Anthropic, most capable | `claude-opus-5` |
| **Claude Sonnet 5** | Anthropic, balanced | `claude-sonnet-5` |
| **Claude Haiku 4.5** | Anthropic, fast | `claude-haiku-4-5` |

Each family has its own id convention on Puter.js: the GPT models take a bare id, the **Codex** models need an `openai/` prefix ([tutorial](https://developer.puter.com/tutorials/free-unlimited-codex-api/)), and the **Claude** models take a bare id again ([tutorial](https://developer.puter.com/tutorials/free-unlimited-claude-35-sonnet-api/)). Puter.js supports several hundred more ids beyond this curated list (o1, o3, the 4.1 line, Gemini, Llama, DeepSeek, Grok, Mistral) — see the [tutorials index](https://developer.puter.com/tutorials/) if you want to wire up additional ones.

> A model id restored from a previous session is checked against this list before use — a stale or tampered value always falls back to the default instead of silently failing.

| Action | How |
| --- | --- |
| Send a message | Type and press `Enter` (`Shift+Enter` for a newline) |
| Switch model | Click the model pill in the chat header, or open the **Models** tab |
| Attach a file | Paperclip icon — an image, a PDF/DOCX, or a text file |
| Generate an image | Image icon next to the input — describes what to draw instead of chatting |
| View / download an image | Click any generated image to zoom in, with a download link |
| Copy a reply | Copy icon under any assistant message |
| Retry a reply | Retry icon under any assistant message — resends the same prompt (or regenerates the image) |
| Start a new chat | The **+** in the sidebar, or **New chat** in the drawer — the previous chat is kept |
| Reopen an old chat | Click it in the sidebar |
| Delete one chat | The **×** on its sidebar row |
| Hide the sidebar | The ☰ button at the left of the chat bar |
| Show a model's thinking | Click the **Reasoning** strip above a reply (reasoning-capable models only) |
| Connect GitHub | **Settings** tab → **Connect GitHub** → load or commit a file in any of your public repos |
| Ask the model to use GitHub | Once connected, just say it in chat — *"read my README and fix the typos"*. Each repo action shows in the transcript, and commits ask first. |
| Set reasoning effort | The picker beside the model pill, on models that support it |
| Save the chat as a PDF | **Save chat as PDF** in the drawer — prints through your browser, so on a phone it lands in the share sheet |
| Sign in / out | Account icon, top right, or the **Settings** tab |

Nothing to configure to get running — no API key, no `.env` file. Everything below is optional:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PORT` | `3000` | Port the static server listens on |
| `PROVIDER_TIMEOUT_CHAT_MS` | `55000` | Total budget per chat request, streaming or not. |
| `PROVIDER_TIMEOUT_HEADERS_MS` | `25000` | Per-attempt deadline for upstream response headers on streams. |
| `PROVIDER_STALL_MS` | `60000` | Aborts a stream quiet longer than this, with a stall message instead of silence. |
| `PROVIDER_TIMEOUT_MODELS_MS` | `20000` | Budget for model-catalogue fetches. |
| `RATE_LIMIT_MAX_ATTEMPTS` | `4` | 429 retries per call, 1–10. Backoff grows per attempt. |
| `AUTH_USER_1` / `AUTH_PASS_1` | *(unset)* | Login gate. Set both halves and the app requires a sign-in; leave either unset and the app stays open to everyone. |
| `AUTH_USER_2` / `AUTH_PASS_2` | *(unset)* | A second account. Optional. |
| `AUTH_USER_3` / `AUTH_PASS_3` | *(unset)* | A third account. Optional — three is the maximum. |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | *(random)* | Signs the login cookie. Set it so sessions survive a restart. |
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` | *(unset)* | GitHub OAuth App client id — enables the GitHub connector in Settings. |
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` | *(unset)* | GitHub OAuth App client secret. |
| `NARA_API_KEY` | *(unset)* | Adds the Nara router — pinned to five allowed models: agnes-2.5-flash, laguna-s-2.1, ling-3.0-flash-fin-free, nemotron-3.5-lightning-free, stepfun-3.7-flash. |
| `NARA_IMAGE_MODEL` | *(unset)* | Image-capable alias for the Edit flow (`/api/llm/images/edits`). Required — edits refuse clearly without it. |
| `NARA_IMAGES_BASE_URL` | *(https://api-images.bynara.id)* | Override for the Nara images host (self-hosted endpoint, proxy, or tests). |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | *(unset)* | Adds OpenRouter — **free tier only**. The picker pins all 19 `:free` models (verified 2026‑09‑12), led by Nemotron 3 Ultra 550B, Inkling / Inkling Small (1M ctx), Nemotron 3.5 Lightning (1M ctx), Gemma 4 31B, Laguna S/XS 2.1 and North Mini Code. `OPENROUTER_FREE_ONLY=0` lifts the free-only gate. |
| `NVIDIA_API_KEY` | *(unset)* | Adds NVIDIA's hosted models — live catalogue (GLM, DeepSeek, Kimi, MiniMax, Devstral, Qwen, Nemotron, Gemma, Mistral, gpt-oss and the rest, as served). |
| `MISTRAL_API_KEY` | *(unset)* | Adds Mistral. |
| `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` | *(unset)* | Adds Vercel AI Gateway — one Bearer key across providers (Laguna S 2.1, Ling 3.0 Flash Sante/Fin, Fish Audio S2.1 Pro among them). |
| `OLLAMA_API_KEY` | *(unset)* | Optional key for Ollama. Set it or `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` (default `http://localhost:11434/v1`) and the live local catalogue appears — GLM, DeepSeek, Kimi, Qwen, MiniMax, Devstral, Nemotron, Mistral, gpt-oss, Muse Glimmer and the rest, whatever the server actually serves. |
| `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` | *(unset)* | Adds Deepgram. Speech service; its chat endpoint answers 404. |
| `ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY` | *(unset)* | Adds AssemblyAI. Speech service; its chat endpoint answers 404. |
| `YOUCOM_API_KEY` | *(unset)* | Adds You.com. Search and research service. |

> Each provider stays out of the picker until its key is set. Any `*_API_KEY` also accepts a matching `*_BASE_URL` override, for a self-hosted endpoint or a proxy.
>
> **OpenRouter free tier, one note.** The picker never offers a paid model by default: the allowlist carries only `:free` ids, a `freeOnly` gate double-checks the live catalogue, and OpenRouter's own rate limits apply (about 20 requests/min; 50/day without any top-up, 1,000/day once you've ever bought $10 of credits). If a pinned id is retired upstream it silently drops out of the picker — and if every pinned id were retired at once, the picker degrades to the full live catalogue instead of going empty.
>
> The last three are speech and search services rather than LLMs. They're wired up so a key can settle it, but a chat request to Deepgram or AssemblyAI returns `404` because neither has a chat completions endpoint.
>
> Model lists are read from each provider at runtime, and free models are floated to the top. Where a provider publishes prices — OpenRouter — that decides it. Where one publishes none, the app assumes an account allowance and shows the catalogue, letting the provider be the one to refuse. That assumption is not always right: a catalogue with no prices can still refuse on billing or plan limits.
>
> A refusal naming one model retires that model. A refusal about the account — "a payment method is required" — suspends the whole provider and switches back to Puter, rather than spending a failed request per model.

> GitHub tokens are sealed with AES-256-GCM using `SESSION_SECRET` and stored in an httpOnly cookie — browser JavaScript never sees them. The connector asks for the `public_repo` scope only, every commit needs an explicit confirmation, and each token is bound to the app account that connected it, so a shared browser can't leak repo access between users.

<br>

<a name="deploy"></a>

<img src="docs/readme/banner-deploy.svg" alt="Deploy to Railway" width="100%">

<br>

```bash
# 1 · push this repo to your own GitHub account (or use it as-is)

# 2 · in Railway: New Project → Deploy from GitHub repo → select the repo

# 3 · Railway auto-detects package.json and runs `npm start` — no env vars needed
```

Your app is live at `https://<project>.up.railway.app` a few seconds later.

### 🩺 Is the deploy actually current?

A 200 from your Railway URL only proves *something* is running. `GET /api/health` answers the real question, needs no login, and is never cached:

```bash
curl -s https://<project>.up.railway.app/api/health
# {"ok":true,"version":"1.0.0","commit":"4b97790…","branch":"main","uptimeSeconds":142,"providers":[…]}
```

`commit` is Railway's `RAILWAY_GIT_COMMIT_SHA`, so comparing it against `git rev-parse main` tells you whether the merge you just made is live instead of guessing from timestamps — and `uptimeSeconds` resets on every deploy, which is the quickest way to see that a redeploy happened at all. `branch` and `commit` are `null` when the server is not running on Railway.

The response carries provider **ids** only. It deliberately never includes keys, base URLs, account names, paths, or even which providers are configured — a public endpoint that lists which of your API keys exist is reconnaissance.

### 🦙 Ollama on Railway (the 502 fix)

`Could not load models: 502: Could not reach Ollama: fetch failed — the provider is slow or unreachable` is the app's own error when its HTTP call to the Ollama base URL fails at the socket level — connection refused, DNS miss, or an unreachable host. On Railway it is nearly always one of the four below, in order:

1. **The base URL still points at localhost.** The default `http://localhost:11434/v1` is correct on your laptop; from the Railway app container it must be the Ollama service's URL: `OLLAMA_BASE_URL=https://<ollama-service>.up.railway.app/v1`, or `http://ollama.railway.internal:11434/v1` for the private network (same Railway project, cheaper and faster).
2. **Ollama listens on loopback inside its own container.** Set `OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:11434` on the Ollama service or it refuses every off-container connection, which the app sees exactly as "fetch failed".
3. **No models are installed.** Railway containers wipe on every deploy, so `ollama pull ...` at runtime disappears on the next one. Attach a volume to the Ollama service at `/root/.ollama`, add a start command like `ollama serve & sleep 8 && ollama pull qwen3:8b && ollama pull gemma3:4b`, and pull small models — Railway has no GPUs, so 8B-class is the practical ceiling.
4. **The free-plan instance was asleep.** Railway's trial/free services sleep and refuse connections while cold — the first request wakes them and can 502 once.

<details>
<summary><b>Step by step</b></summary>

<br />

1. Railway project → **+ New → Docker Image** → `ollama/ollama`, or **+ New → GitHub Repo** with a Dockerfile based on `ollama/ollama`.
2. On the Ollama service → **Settings → Networking → Generate Domain** (this is the public URL for `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`) and set the variable `OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:11434`.
3. On the Ollama service → **Storage → + New Volume**, mount path `/root/.ollama`, so pulled models survive deploys.
4. Add a start command that seeds a small model before serving: `sh -c "ollama serve & sleep 8 && ollama pull qwen3:8b && ollama pull gemma3:4b && wait"`. Verify with `curl https://<ollama-service>.up.railway.app/api/tags` — you should see the pulled models listed.
5. On the **freeopenai** service, set:

| Variable | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` | `https://<ollama-service>.up.railway.app/v1` (or `http://ollama.railway.internal:11434/v1`) |
| `OLLAMA_API_KEY` | *(leave unset — keyless is fine, the URL alone enables the provider)* |

6. Open the app → provider picker → **Ollama**. The dropdown fills from the live `/v1/models`; anything missing there is a model Ollama hasn't pulled, not an app error.

</details>

### 🧩 Modes & skills (opencode-style)

The composer has a mode chip that cycles **Chat → Plan → Build**, the same three modes opencode uses:

| Mode | What it does | Skills applied |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Chat** | Default assistant — ask anything | None (fast, general) |
| **Plan** | Reasons about the task, writes an implementation plan, changes nothing | planning/writing skills as matched |
| **Build** | Executes with the full tool loop, TDD-first discipline | methodology core + best-matched skills |

Skills are pulled automatically from three open libraries — no setup, cached 6h, degrading to the last-good copy if GitHub is down:

| Library | What it contributes |
| --- | --- |
| [anthropics/skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) | The full official set (frontend-design, docx, pdf, mcp-builder, …) |
| [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) | Development methodology: TDD, systematic debugging, verification before completion |
| [JuliusBrussee/caveman](https://github.com/JuliusBrussee/caveman) | Lite pick: `lean-build`, `surgical-patch`, `verify-and-stop`, `caveman-commit`, `caveman` |

How auto-application works: each request's text is scored against every skill's name + description (stemmed, name hits weighted 3×, generic verbs ignored). The top matches ride along as extra system context in Plan and Build modes; Build additionally seeds the process core (TDD, verification-before-completion, lean-build) every turn. In Build mode the model can also call the `use_skill` tool to load any skill's full text mid-task.

- `GET /api/skills` — the installed catalogue (source, name, description)
- `GET /api/skills/content?source=<repo>&name=<skill>` — one skill's full SKILL.md
- `SKILLS_CACHE_TTL_MS` — cache lifetime override (default 6h)

### 🐙 Working with GitHub

Set `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` (from a [GitHub OAuth App](https://github.com/settings/developers) whose callback URL is `https://<your-app>/api/github/callback`) and a **Connect GitHub** row appears in Settings.

Once connected, the model can work with your repos directly:

| Tool | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `github_list_repos` | Lists public repos across every connected account |
| `github_list_files` | Lists a folder, so it can find a path |
| `github_read_file` | Reads one file |
| `github_commit_file` | Writes and commits — **always asks you first** |

Up to **three accounts** can be connected at once. Which one acts on a repo is resolved in a fixed order: an explicitly named account, then the repo's owner, and otherwise it refuses and asks — it never tries tokens in turn until one works, because guessing wrong on a write means committing under the wrong identity.

> Untick **Expire user access tokens** when registering the OAuth App. Refresh tokens aren't implemented, so an expiring token would silently disconnect after 8 hours.

### 🩹 Provider quirks the app works around

Puter fronts several providers, and they disagree in ways that surface as raw API errors. These are handled rather than passed through:

| Quirk | What the app does |
| --- | --- |
| Claude returns `message.content` as an array of blocks, not a string | Normalizes both shapes, so replies don't render as `[object Object]` |
| Claude asks for tools with `tool_use` blocks, not `message.tool_calls` | Normalizes to one shape the tool loop understands |
| Some Claude models reject the effort setting with a `thinking.type` error | Retries once without it, then hides the picker for that model |
| A reply object carries `model`, `id`, `usage` | Strips them before echoing the turn back, which the provider rejects otherwise |
| Codex model ids need an `openai/` prefix | Baked into the model list |
| A free-tier provider answers `429 Too Many Requests` | The server retries with backoff (up to 4 attempts, ~17s worst case) and the page gives it one more try, so a rate-limited NVIDIA burst rides itself out instead of failing every message. |
| The user stops a streaming reply | The red stop button (or Escape) aborts the fetch, and the server cancels the upstream request the moment the client disconnects, so a cancelled answer doesn't keep burning tokens. |

<br>

<a name="architecture"></a>

<img src="docs/readme/banner-architecture.svg" alt="Architecture" width="100%">

<br>

**Request path.** Browser loads `index.html` → Puter.js authenticates the user and meters usage → the page calls `puter.ai.chat()` directly from the browser → the reply streams back into the chat. When a direct-provider key is configured, the chat goes through `server.js`, which streams the upstream SSE body straight to the client so tokens still appear one at a time without a full-page wait. `server.js` caches the model catalogue in memory to avoid re-fetching on every provider switch.
